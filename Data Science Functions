# Three commonly used functions in Data Science are the following: max(), min(), and mean()

# max() function finds the highest value in an array
average_pulse_max = max(80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125)
print(average_pulse_max)
# In which this will display 125 to the console

# min() functions finds the lowest value in an array
average_pulse_min = min(80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125)
print(average_pulse_min)
# In which this will display 80 to the console

# mean() is a Numpy function used to find the average value of an array
# Numpy is another library in Python that's used for working with arrays
# We first import numpy library as np
import numpy as np
Calorie_burnage = [240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330]
# In the next statement, we put np in front of mean so that way Python knows to activate the mean() function from the Nump library
average_calories_burned = np.mean(Calorie_burnage)
print(average_calories_burned)
# Which will output 285.0 to the console
