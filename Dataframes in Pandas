# Importing the Pandas Library as pd
import pandas as pd

# Define the data with columns and rows in a variable that's named 'd'
# 'col1', 'col2', 'col3' are the columns and the rows are the data in the brackets []
d = {'col1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 7], 'col2': [4, 5, 6, 9, 5], 'col3': [7, 8, 12, 1, 11]}

# Next we create a dataframe using the function pd.DataFrame() from the Pandas(pd) library and assign that to the 'df' variable
# and we put in the () 'data = d' which lets the function know to use the data from the d variable
df = pd.DataFrame(data = d)

# Then we print out the dataframe(df) to the console
print(df)

# We can count the number of columns in the dataframe(df) by doing the following:
count_column = df.shape[1]
print(count_column)
# Which in this case will let us know there's 3 columns

# We can also count the number of rows in the dataframe(df) by doing the following:
count_row = df.shape[0]
print(count_row)
# Which in this case will let us know it's 5 rows
